counteract the pathological action of TGFbeta1 and reduce heart failure severity.,29346771:Authors demonstrate that neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) is one of the molecules involved and show that it mediates spine reorganization and contributes to the behavioral sensitization.,29999523:CD56(neg) Natural Killer cells constitute functionally competent cells sharing many features of bona

Altogether, these results show that PAK3 and PAK1 signaling may be coordinated by heterodimerization.,23335370:Pak proteins are key components of multiple engraftment-associated hematopoietic stem cells functions and play a direct role in activation of ERK in hematopoietic stem cells.,24163148:Our results indicate that Pak3 is a novel regulator of beta-cell differentiation and function. Pak3 acts downstream of Ngn3 to promote cell cycle exit and differentiation in the embryo by a mechanism that might involve repression of Ccnd1.,27940202:Pak3 knockout (KO) mice had defects of oligodendrocyte differentiation in developing corpus callosum and to a lesser extent in anterior commissure, which were compensated at the adult stage. In vitro experiments in oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) cultures, derived from Pak3 KO and wild type brains, support a developmental and cell-autonomous role for PAK3 in regulating OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes.,29860311:Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PAKs decreases ATXN1 levels in a mouse model of SCA1. To explore the potential of using PAK inhibitors in combination therapy, we combined the pharmacological inhibition of PAK with MSK1, a previously identified modulator of ATXN1, and examined their effects on ATXN1 levels. We found that inhibition of both pathways results in an additive decrease in ATXN1 levels.,31943058:The intellectual disability PAK3 R67C mutation impacts cognitive functions and adult hippocampal

In contrast, the liver only expressed EAAT2 (but 2 C-terminal splice variants).,29463856:Reduced Cerebellar EAAT1 Expression associated with loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells resluts in neurodegeneration and Niemann-Pick disease Type C1.,29615452:These data reveal that stem/progenitor cell activation is synchronized over distinct niches during growth and identify SLC1A3 as a general marker and effector of activated epithelial stem/progenitor cells throughout the skin.,29737454:beta-catenin inactivation in GLAST-expressing cells enhanced anxious/depressive-like responses.,29741614:GLAST role in the spontaneous firing pattern and survival of Purkinje cells.,30122553:p53 promotes the expression of SLC1A3, an aspartate/glutamate transporter that allows the utilization of aspartate to support cells in the absence of extracellular glutamine. Tumor cells with high levels of SLC1A3 expression are resistant to glutamine starvation, and SLC1A3 depletion retards the growth of these cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a therapeutic potential for SLC1A3 inhibition.,30953407:SLC1A3 rs1049522 showed significant association with ADHD risk.  rs1049522-C allele enhanced SLC1A3 expression by disrupting the hsa-miR-3171 binding site.,31582286:In
